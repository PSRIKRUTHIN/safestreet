SafeStreet – Road Damage Detection & Alert System

SafeStreet is an AI-based project designed to detect various types of road damage from real-world images using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The goal is to assist civic bodies and citizens by alerting about dangerous road conditions through an integrated mobile app.
Project Overview

- Detects and classifies road damages into 4 categories:
  - Crack
  - Pothole
  - Patch
  - Surface
- Alerts are sent to admin users (planned backend integration)
- Results are visualized in a mobile app (under development using React Native and Expo Go)
 Technologies Used

-  Model: Vision Transformer (ViT)
-  Framework: Pytorch
-  Frontend:
  - Mobile: React Native + Expo Go
  - Web: React.js (admin panel)
-  Backend: Node.js + Express (in progress)
-  Database: MongoDB (in progress)
-  Dataset: Custom-labeled road damage image dataset
